## **Links:**

We use links to make navigation easier between pages, the element we use is <a></a> then w specify the link inside using the href attribute there is also a text between the opening tag <a> and the closing tag </a> which is to help the user find the way, you can tell him directly saying ‚Äúclick on this‚Äù for example, many people look for text links going through sites, finding good links in your website encourages users to interact more with it and find it more appealing, in choosing words things can get tricky, you need to pick good words so people use these words while searching, these can be specified to make access easier, links can take you to other pages but they have some specialties, some links can take you to new tabs some can take you to email or even open your email program, some other links can take you to another part of the same page and we can trigger that using the id element.

## **Grids:**

Grids layouts are the most fun of all, they contain rows and columns in order to organize items, you can specify these or make them float to get a clip chart look, it is good for articles like magazines, or good for pictures, we do this using the <div></div> tag and div is used to grouped elements in sections of the page, browsers sometimes display your images normally so you have to check the position you want them in whether it was fixed, floating or absolute, the float moves the element to the right or to the left it can be used to create column layouts, pages can be set to be stretchy or fixed width, usually designers keep the width between 900 to 1000 pixels, this is why setting the fixed properties with grids can create good flexible websites, CSS helps us with that as it‚Äôs framework provides us with these tasks, and we can always add CSS files by creating new files and linking them to our page.

## **Functions:**

A function allows us to assemble some statements together in order to accomplish an objective 
Creating a function:
1.	We can initiate a Function command name it and then write the statement
2.	Calling a function code inside a function won‚Äôt be executed at defining the function, the code inside a function is executed when the function is invoked, we can use the term "call a function" instead of "invoke a function", or also say "call upon a function", "start a function", or "execute a function".
3.	Adding variables to add information Function parameters are the names listed in the function arguments are the real values passed to (and received by) the function
4.	Calling functions with information we can call a function with a given this value and arguments provided individually, to execute them in order
5.	Getting either a single or multiple value A function won‚Äôt return multiple values but you can make separate functions
