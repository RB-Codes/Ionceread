In HTML we can find three types of lists: ordered lists, unordered lists and definition lists.
Ordered lists have numbers as they are ordered numerically.
Unordered lists have bullets they are usually used for menus and such.
Definition lists are used to define terminology.
Lists in HTML have the adaptability to be nested inside one another.

*Boxes:*
There are main properties for boxes in HTML:
Borders
All of the boxes have borders so they becomes separated one from another.
*Margin:*
Margins are right outside the borders as it grows in width it creates gaps with surroundings 
*Padding:*
Padding is the gap between the box and the content inside increasing it gives more reading ability
