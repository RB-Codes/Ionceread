Forms
Forms are important, they resemble the data basic entry function in our pages, and the best form in a page is the Google search box, it has received billions of billions of entries through the years, forms can be a single line input or a hidden password box, also we can make a text area which is a multi-line space that can be used for comments or messages, we also have the choice forms such as buttons, checkboxes and dropdown boxes, there are also the submitting forms like buttons with pictures and so.
We can use the tag <form> creating forms every time we require information from our visitors.
Information are sent from there in a name and value pairs, there is a unique name for every form control, everything is sent to the server afterwards, now forms are better supported with HTML5 which has made the whole process much easier.

Tables & Forms
Other than CSS properties that can be added to elements of content, there are some additional properties to be used to control list appearances as well as tables and forms.
List markers can have a wide diversity of appearances with list style type and list style image properties.
Cells in tables may have different borders and spacing and this is determined by the browser software, therefore we can use some properties to control this and make them more consistent.
Forms usage can be much easier if we align form controls vertically in our CSS.
Forms can be enhanced with styles to get them going and make them interactive.

Events
Flow of events matters when our code has got some handlers of events and one of its ancestors or descendant elements.
The event object tells where the event occurs on the diagram.
