Error handling and debugging:
- Javascript is not easy, users commit mistakes all the time whilst writing code, this is why we must learn to find our error in code, also we should write scripts that handle possible errors in a good way.
We have to understand that javascript is interpreted, its interpreter processes line by line when going through code, if any statement required some results from an additional function, it stacks the new function on top of the mean objective.

- To expect error you have to comprehend the rules of code stacks and how the code executes.
We call the process of finding errors debugging, this process includes some deduction with it.
- We also can never forget the console, which does more than enough narrowing down the area which we locate the error in, sometimes we can find the exact reason using it.

- There are a variety of errors, however each error creates an object for its own, this is why Javascript 7 calls out the line number and describes it which is too helpful.
- Just knowing that you might get errors is helpful, you can use the try, catch, finally statements, we can use them to provide feedback to our users.
