# Responsive 

Through our work we found out that a page sometimes doesn't 
follow expected patterns and look different from the original
design, we could use the normal CSS but it was not good enough,
if something changed the page size or somebody tried to access it from another source the page would get all messed up, this is why we need responsivness, a term which means that our page is going to adhere to the opted look and it will preerve it's contents even if the device changes, and this help a lot with the huge variey we have now in the market, from laptops to smartphones etc..
