Domain modeling is a set of steps we do to create a pre-thought model for a certain problem, and a well-built domain model can confirm and reflect our understanding for this problem.
     And when we decide to start modelling there are some guidelines we can abide:
1.	While modelling a single entity that is to have big number of instances, our objects are better made self-contained so they have the same attributes and behaviors.
2.	We better model its attributes with the constructor function which defines and initializes properties.
3.	We should model its behaviors with small methods which shall focus on having one task that they do best.
4.	We must create instances with the help of the keyword ‚Äònew‚Äô then we call a constructor function right after
5.	We store the object we created recently in a variable for we can access its properties and methods even outside the function
6.	The variable ‚Äòthis‚Äô allows us to access and object‚Äôs property and methods from inside the object

What‚Äôs a table?!!
A table can represent the data in a grid format its used a lot like marks financial sheets and such.

How do memory and variables work?
Global variables take up more memory space, our browser is obliged to remember them all the time, while the local ones are only executed when their code is executed

‚Ä¢	Creating object 
To create objects easily we use what is known as literal nation the object is stored as a variable with a name for example car and in the curly braces we find it and its content, now we have to separate each key from its value with a colon and each property and method with a comma but not after the end of the code.
‚Ä¢	To access a property in Dot Nation
We use dot nation or square brackets to access the methods of an object we use the name of the object followed by a period then the name of the property and this is known as dot nation, the dot is called the member operator while the property to its right is a member of the object, 
Var carType = car.name;
Var keyType =key.type();
But we can also use this way 
Var carType = car [‚Äòtype‚Äô];
