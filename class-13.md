We first might talk about cookies 
* Cookies on a computer are files that contain information like surfing habits, server settings and type of browser. Once the data is collected, the Web server places the cookie (file) on the user's hard drive. If the user visits the site again, the server retrieves the information from the file, then uses it to identify the visitor.

Cookies are actual files that are stored on your hard drive. The more you surf the Web, the more cookies you accumulate. Cookies build over time, and can take up quite a bit of storage space. Also, your browser may start and run slower, and your system may lag or hang up if hard drive space is limited. Fortunately, browsers like Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer have options to clear the cache and delete cookies either manually or automatically when you exit the browser.

HTML5:
HTML5‚Äôs local storage feature allows the browser to store and retrieve specific data. In this post, we‚Äôll pick up where we left off in the previous post where we built a real-time CSS editor using the HTML5 contenteditable attribute. Now we‚Äôre going to learn how to save our edited content to the browser‚Äôs local storage, then clear it when we no longer need it.
