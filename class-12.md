The canvas element seems just like the image element but without sec and alt attributes it does have the two essential ones the width and the height, but still they are optional and can be added with the DOM properties, if we don't provide them they will be set by default values taking 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high, also the element can be set by CSS.
