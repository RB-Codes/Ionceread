•	Creating object 
To create objects easily we use what is known as literal nation the object is stored as a variable with a name for example car and in the curly braces we find it and its content, now we have to separate each key from its value with a colon and each property and method with a comma but not after the end of the code.
•	To access a property in Dot Nation
We use dot nation or square brackets to access the methods of an object we use the name of the object followed by a period then the name of the property and this is known as dot nation, the dot is called the member operator while the property to its right is a member of the object, 
Var carType = car.name;
Var keyType =key.type();
But we can also use this way 
Var carType = car [‘type’];

•	Caching dom query:
There are methods that can find elements in the DOM tree and we can call them the DOM queries, this can be easier when we want to work with an element more than once so we use this query, when our script opts finding or changing an element the interpreter should look for it in the DOM query

•	Selecting an element
Which can be done with 
Document.getElementById(‘one’)

•	Selecting an element from the node list

•	Repeating actions for the whole node list 

•	Looping in a node list
