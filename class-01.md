## *Hello every one*
# Let's talk about web development

### HTML
 we all have heard about HTML, but if you want to be a developer you need to read more about them, html is the fundumental part of a webpage, it holds the core structure of it, it is a semantic amazing language it containts commands that are user friendly and help you improve because they are not hard to comprehend.

 I want you to guess what are the following commands:

 1. <Head>
 2. <Body>
 3. <P>
 4. <Style>
 5. <Main>

 you might have not known all of the commands, but yet some of them resembles the exact meaning of what it says, every page contains a head that holds the title and the important links for other pages (we will cover that later), the big part of the webpage is the body, it holds most major elements inside like headers, paragraphs, footers and images as well.

### CSS

CSS is a little tricky, it is the styling part of a webpage, it helps our page look smarter and lively, CSS styles can be added externally as a style sheet linked in our head section, or intergrated internally in the head or even in line

### Javascript

Javascript is the engine of the page, it makes our page come to life, it provides interactions to the user to make things easier, it can give the user commands, it can talk to our guests and make their journey in our page fun
