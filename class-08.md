Usually pages in browsers are displayed in normal flow until the aspect is specified to either relative, absolute or fixed positioning.

The property called float is responsible of moving the content to the right or the left of the page that is why it is good to create layouts made of many columns, but floated items are better to have a certain given widths.
You can use fixed width or a liquid which is the stretchy layout.

Designers usually maintain a 960-1000 pixel width for a page, and specify the main purpose of the site in the top 600 pixels, so a user can get the point without having to scroll down.
There are the grids which help us a lot in creating an advanced and dynamic designs.

CSS frameworks supply us with rules for basic tasks.
A developer is free to include more than one CSS file to the page, however when conflicting the last one is the one that takes effect.
