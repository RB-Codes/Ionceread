## ***CSS Style***   üòÅ

a CSS command is a selctor and a decleration, the selector choses an element to style and the decleration gives it the property you need, we can select few or many elements as we have universal selectors which affect all elements with the attribute selected, also we can have a class which affects all elements within the class selected, we can also select according to an element or we can give some unique element an ID and play with it as we like, we can change everything from font family to font size to color to margins, CSS provides many ways to style pages.

## ***Variables***   üòÅ

to announce a variable we need some key elements, starting with the word var which initiates a variable it is a keyword that tells javascript that we are creating a variable, secondly to make it count we name our variable it is good to give it a unique name as if it was our own child "flesh and blood" because this is what a true programmer does, if the name was too huge then it won't be huger than a camel, put it in camelCase so you don't make things complicated, also the name must begin with a letter a dollar sign or a _, but it should not start with a number, we can't use javascript keywords, the name itself can contain signs and numbers, and variables like babies are case sensitive to be careful, also give the name a good menaing it must reflect what your doing to make the process of coding easier.

afterwards we can use the variable because we won't just look at it right? but how do we use it, the easy way is to use functions, these operate variables according to the variable value, and this changes by many factors, program type, function type or even the positioning of the variable in our code
