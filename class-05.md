Images have to be the following
1.	Referring to our subject or topic
2.	Have good information 
3.	 Be suitable to the theme if the page
4.	Be recognizable immediately
5.	Belong to the color group we using 


To add an image we will need the image tag <img></img> we also give it a title and we add the link of this image using src and also talk about it with the alt, if we want to create an image then we must bear in mid three things saving the image itself in the right format and the right size and use correct resolution.

Colors in computer come from mixing different amounts of blue red and green 
1.	RGB values, which are red green blue and they are expressed with numbers from 0 to 255 for example this can be a color rgb(3,56,230)
2.	Hex Code they are also red green blue but in hexadecimal format example #22aabb
3.	Color names looks easy but it isn‚Äôt, to use it with advanced colors you need to memorize the difference between them
Colors have three traits:
1.	HUE which is the near colloquial a color will also have brightness and saturation 
2.	Saturation this gives us the amount of grey there is in a color we should have none at maximum saturation and at minimum the color almost turns grey
3.	Brightness it refers to how much black there is in a color at max brightness there would be no black and vice versa

CSS3 also allows us to specify colors with HSL values, as an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.

We can always control aspects of text as font, size, weight, style, and spacing, there not many fonts people have installed so you must pick a font wisely, to increase the types there are many ways but we need the license to use them, we can modify spacing between lines in texts and between letters as well or words even, we can also align texts to different directions, we can use pseudo-classes to change the element style when user hovers over text clicks or when visiting a link.
